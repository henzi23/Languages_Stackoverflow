# Languages_Stackoverflow

Repo to store analysis aimed to investigate what are hte best programming languages to learn to be a software developer.  For this analysis we utilize the 2017 StackOverflow developer survey results and look to answer:
* What programming languages do professional developers most commonly use?
* What programming languages do professional developers want to use in the next year?
* Does the amount of experience (years in coding job) affect the distribution for commonly used and want to use programming language?


The summary of findings are:
* Current usage is dominated by staple programming languages like Java, SQL,C. Python, and PHP.
* Investigating languages desired to be utilized found up and coming languages like Go and Swift popping into the top 10.
* Analysis by extent of coding experience showed no more differences in language current or desired future usage between groups.
